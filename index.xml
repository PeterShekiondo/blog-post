As I was missing this VS Code extension when working on neovim, an idea popped up: What if I write an HTTP grammar and an execute request from an interactive prompt?
Preview:
Preparation For our grammar, we need to make sure we understand the HTTP standard defined here.</description></item><item><title>Automate an articles section in your github.io page</title><link>https://protiumx.dev/blog/posts/automate-an-articles-section-in-your-github-io-page/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://protiumx.dev/blog/posts/automate-an-articles-section-in-your-github-io-page/</guid><description>Today I wanted to update my github page to show a list of my last Medium articles. I ended up automating it.
First approach My first attempt was fetching the RSS feed using the URL medium.com/feed/@username and parse the xml document. But I was hit with a charming CORS error. Now what?
I remembered that I&amp;rsquo;m using a github action to update a similar section on my github profile. So, what if I tell this action that the README file is called index.</description></item><item><title>kitty + zsh + powerlevel10k = ✨ aesthetics ✨</title><link>https://protiumx.dev/blog/posts/kitty-zsh-powerlevel10k-aesthetics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://protiumx.dev/blog/posts/kitty-zsh-powerlevel10k-aesthetics/</guid><description>Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like a good looking terminal and useful layouts and keymaps? This has always been my goal since I started using linux as main OS.
I have used lots of different terminals, plugins and settings over the years but I think now I achieved the glory with my current setup:
Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look to the configuration.
What do I use?

Relative paths In release v0.4.1 I added support for relative paths which means you can now use github to host the media you use in your blog posts. How does it work? Just use relative paths (to the markdown file) and you are ready to go. E.g. The action replaces all relative paths with the raw content github urls.</description></item><item><title>Publish your blog articles everywhere with this github action</title><link>https://protiumx.dev/blog/posts/publish-your-blog-articles-with-this-github-action/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://protiumx.dev/blog/posts/publish-your-blog-articles-with-this-github-action/</guid><description>Long ago I made this comment in this article:
This is a really good idea with great potential. Imagine a standarized API for different blogs. You can automatize publishing and editing, multiple collaborators. and use a git provider as unique source of content. And you can also make your git repo as some sort of blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll use it for my next posts for sure. Thanks!
It was an idea that I had left on the back of my head and I didn&amp;rsquo;t come back to it because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t writing articles actively.</description></item></channel></rss>
